Overall architecture of Geometry-Invariant DOA Estimation Network (GI-DOAEnet) with Microphone Positional Encoding (MPE). With $C$-channel signals and the coordinates of microphones, the geometry-invariant network structure estimates the azimuth.

## Microphone Positional Encoding (MPE)

- **Phase Modulation (PM)**:

- **Frequency Modulation (FM)**:

$M$ is the latent feature size. $r_{c}$, $\theta_{c}$, and $\phi_{c}$ are the distance, azimuth, and elevation angles of the $c$-th microphone, respectively. $\alpha$ is a amplitude scaling factor, and $\beta$ is a frequency scaling factor.

## Running the Code
You can infer the code by running by **python inference.py**. You can change the MPE type between **FM** and **PM** in the Python file.\
If you want to check the FLOPS and parameters of the model, uncomment the "count_flops_and_params" function in line 79 and change the device to "cpu".
